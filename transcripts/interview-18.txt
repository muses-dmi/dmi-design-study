# Why do you use your chosen programming language(s) and how did you come to use them?

I use Max because it helps for fast prototyping, and C++ to implement the simulations in JUCE.
 
 
# Why do you use your chosen tools for instrument design?  and how did you come to use them?
(You may consider both physical and software tools.)

I use Matlab to check the quality of the simulations and C++ to make them in realtime. I am not sure honestly how I came to use them.
 
 
 
# Why did you chose your chosen platform to build your instrument on? 

I use bela and arduino because they are very well documented and bela allows to run dsp on it with low latency.
 
 
 
# Are there any other tools (software or otherwise) that you feel contributes significantly to your process? 
 
 
Yes Overleaf for documenting the work done.
 
# What would be the biggest 'Quality of Life' improvement you could request from your tools for designing DMI? 

 
Nothing really. Only more time to work on these things :)

# How do you approach the design of a new instrument? 
I usually find an interesting sounding object in the real world and try to reproduce it in software.
 
 
 
# When creating a new instrument, what distinct aspects are required to realize the design and implementation? 
 

For me it is very important that the instrument does not merely reproduce an existing one but also extends it.
 
# What do you consider as the biggest challenge when designing an instrument? 
(Feel free to refer to specific problems from your experience or more generally from you opinion)
 
 I think the tools available nowadays are very solid and well designed, both from the users’ and developers’ perspective.
The challenge is the design of a proper interface and the design of instruments which are not played only by one or few individuals.
 
# What tools do (or could) play the biggest part in helping with these challenges?  
 
I think a larger collaborative team where there is also a designer involved who is able to professionally build the interface to control such instruments.
 

# How would you define a DMI? 
 
A DMI is a digital acoustic object that can be interactively manipulated and played with.
 
 
# What concepts do you consider a DMI to be made up from? 
The software component but also the way we interact with it. So the interface and the mappings are as important as the software element.
