# Why do you use your chosen programming language(s)?

Well, I think it's I think it's a combination of I mean, sort of like, why you would choose a language for any reason. It's a combination like the tools and the work that have already been done by other people. For instance, like Max MSP is fully supported they have, they're releasing new packages and things all the time. Fantastic prototyping environment, particularly for sound design because they have a lot of common tools that are also available in other languages and other situations. So I use that I use Max for Yeah, for like quick prototyping. It has also like UI and gooey stuff built in also, like very easily accessible. It's not the first language that I learned the first the first language I learned with supercollider. But it's the one that I became most fluent in most quickly. And so I use it for that reason. supercollider I use a because it's possible to run it on embedded devices, you can run it on a Raspberry Pi, it's

open source, there's all the things and the sound quality is fantastic. The other languages Python, is you know, a little slow, gently, you know, in terms, you know, compared to a lot of the a lot of other languages that, you know, compiled to assembly, but

it's, again, just like super robust, very supported. It's been around for a long time, unlike rust that I'm getting into rest now because of how efficient and tiny it can be. And also, it's just, you know, as I'm learning to code it, it feels it just feels really nice to write in. But it's so young, they're still developing it, there's you know, I'm, I'm working on something right now that's embedded in once to use capacitive touch sensing over i squared c. And I have to write drivers for anything that I want to use if I'm doing it in rust, and that's something that I'm not super well versed in right now. And so it's just more time and energy but rust for its quickness, efficiency and also ability to run an embedded devices. And then Arduino, I guess it's sort of for the same reason as Max MSP, it's fantastic for prototyping, lots of support. And a lot of people have done and shared their, you know, done things then share their work, which makes it you know, a quick Google to figure out how to do something as opposed to having to, you know, look up data sheets and things like that. But

> I assume you mean that c++ in the context of arduino?

yeah, yeah, the version of c++ that's specifically Yeah, in the Arduino. Yeah. 

# Why do you use your chosen tools for instrument design?

Sure, yeah. So I have a master's degree in electronic music and recording. And I got it from Mills College, which, unfortunately, is, is transitioning out of being a college and more into an institute. But there's a long legacy of a combination of composition, improvisation, and electronic music all in that department. And while I was there, I took I want to say I took two semesters, concurrently of improvised music ensemble. So it was me on electronics, and this sort of tabletop percussion setup that I have with other people who are playing instruments like saxophone or electric guitar, or violin, or voice, you know, all sorts of different choices. And in my studies, they're particularly studying with one of my professors. He said that his main issue in improvising with electronic musicians is that there's a delay, there's always a delay, because they're coding or they're writing or, you know, patching or something. And they can't just respond immediately to whatever's happening in the music. And so I set out primarily to, to, to find and further develop tools that allowed for more immediacy in electronic music performance. That's been my main goal, particularly with digital instruments, you know, with you know, I work in analogue synthesis also, when I play, I play, I hate we need another term for this, but real instruments, you know, like I play will say more traditional instruments as well. trombone, bass, guitar, percussion. And, in my experience with those instruments, there's of course, this you know, you put it to your mouth, you hit it or whatever and then you get the sound and so trying to model that and explore the relationship between interface and sound is something that i'm really interested in and so the tools that i'm to get to your question the tools that i use i try to find tools that are optimised for a combination of immediacy and flexibility in addition to things like sound quality right

yeah and

i guess that specifically also relates to for instance like like a keyboard based midi controller and knobs and sliders are readily available if there's already protocols for them all that's taken care of but given my instrumental music background i'm not really a keyboard player and so i've gone out in search of other interfaces other ways of working with manipulating sound and a lot of that has led me into custom design right so things like touch for instance so capacitive sensing and proximity sensors infrared i know roland for a little while had like their their infrared proximity sensor on some keyboards and you know each of these modes of interfacing has a different what i want to say it different benefits different things that they're good at just like every instrument has certain things that it's good and not particularly good at and so i guess like trying to find out also trying to use software and hardware tools that allow for a diversity of explorations in these in these things you know whether i'm starting with sound design and the designing hardware interface for that or i have an idea for hardware interface designing software for that i think that flexibility is important

# Why did you chose your chosen platform(s) to build your instrument on?

at this point it's familiarity i see you have a bella sticker behind you on the on your shelves i haven't used bella because i you know the the tools that i the tools that i learned particularly when i was an undergrad just continue to work for me but i am curious about about other platforms i think it's just like these are the platforms that were available when i was in academia and in you know for my

undergraduate degree and they've continued to work you know i am curious about it but they call them programming languages for a reason and learning each new language or each new interface

you know takes more time and so if the i guess the main thing is if the efficiency like sort of the promise of the efficiency of the new device or platform is worth the time and energy it takes to learn it that i'm that i'm curious about it norns for instance is a platformer i didn't know any lua going into programming for norns but the platform is used by so many people now and is so robust it's supported by supercollider so i can also create my own engines for that that platform isn't is one where i started learning because i saw all this potential you know it's a lot of shortcuts it takes care of a lot of the work that i had to do whenever i would try to make an embedded instrument it's like they they take care of a lot of that stuff already so

> Does ESP32 factor in in that same sense, or was that something that you picked up in the like the sense that there was a promise and you came to that?

yeah esp was funny because i've been trying to do why particularly osc over wireless networks for really long time and there were stuffer osc for wired networks and wi fi protocols on arduino in the id but there was no library that seemed to support like particularly osc over wi fi it was like pulling teeth and then esp came out they're like yeah it works with the standard wi fi library and arduino i was like oh great and so then i just immediately started using it and now looking at the advances that they've made to it's like oh this might i might only need to use the esp chip to do some of this stuff if it's a very basic interface then it could all just be on board which

# Are there any other tools (software or otherwise) that you feel contributes significantly to your process?

yeah i think a lot of it has been so a lot of my work especially in the last few years has been focused on touch and i think and particularly bringing that into electronic music i think a lot of the work that's been done around that area hasn't necessarily been around expressivity or expressiveness a lot of it has just been about sort of either binary interfacing or like the click wheel on an ipod you know way back or whatever that thing is you know and so i think a lot of the information and things that i've gotten from that and sort of just in general has been lineage has been my teachers and other people who have explored this stuff before and have more experience and ideas you know because i think open source culture is really important and i have the career that i do because of google like hands down i wouldn't know anything that i know if it wasn't for the internet but with the exception of what i've learned from from the people that i've studied with or the people that i've worked with residences and things like that so it's not software hardware but it's like a very important aspect of my work is you know

i think also the instruments that i've played it that like the more traditional instruments that i played whether it's an orchestra band or in in

like rock bands and things like that also like really influenced how i think about interfacing with electronic instruments

# What would be the biggest 'Quality of Life' improvement you could request from your tools for designing DMI?

i'd like something that and max msp kind of does this but it's not embedded and it's you know it, pd i guess is the closest thing to this but i'd love to be able to take something from prototyping to reality very quickly you know that the move from concept to implementation particularly in hardware design is tedious especially you know a lot of the manufacturing and stuff happens overseas too and so like the timelines are stretched out and so i think it would be you know i see a 3d printer there too and i think like there's a lot of promise in certain areas around like home sort of cottage level manufacturing that can help with that but yeah i think that the biggest thing is is yes or the move from prototyping to to sort of finished product

# How do you approach the design of a new instrument?

i guess it's sort of like how do you approach writing a song or something right it's like it usually it starts with some seed or some inspiration whether it's an idea for you know it might be i've had some conceptual instruments where i'm thinking like okay well this is this instrument is designed to explore relationship whether it's you know you mentioned phenomenology earlier whether it's a phenomenological experience with an instrument or some sort of interconnectivity between two people using these instruments so sometimes this will start conceptually sometimes it will just be that i have made a really cool sound when i'm you know exploring or playing around in with you know with with sounds and think oh i'd really like to be able to play this you know to explore or or to move it into a live context for instance i really enjoyed performing live and so a lot of that is like how can i take the sound and then make it so that i can can use it in stage basically and then sometimes it's you know i have this circuit board lying around or for instance touch i wanted to make a touch controller and then i needed to design some sounds to go with that so i guess you know sometimes it's hard to interface sometimes it's starts with the sound and i want to be able to control it and sometimes it's about concept

# When creating a new instrument, what distinct aspects are required to realize the design and implementation?

Oh man, there's so many. Okay, let me get this up here with creating a new instrument, what design aspects are required to realise the design implementation? Yeah, yeah, sorry. I would say boundaries would be a really important thing. What does this thing need to do? And what does it not need to do? Especially because, like in when you're working with modular synthesisers, or Macs or any of these things, it's the potential there's so much potential. In fact, I think there might be one could argue that there's the potential can sometimes be paralysing. Because it's, as instrument makers, we get to decide the relationships between the interface and the sound that comes out. And in general, there may be a caveat to this. But previously, instrument designs were dictated by physics. And so if you wanted a string to vibrate, you had to deal with tensions and, and, and mass and movement and all of these things, right, you had to build the structures for resonators, and all these things. And physics was a boundary there, and continues to be in terms of these instruments that are not electronic. But something that's really compelling to me is that we get to choose the aspects and the boundaries of the instruments that were making. And so I think, making decisions about what those are is absolutely required to realise it. I think from there, let's say software, I think we need to know that it's possible. We need to prototype and see like, is it interesting? Do I find it because I mostly make things for myself? And so like, do I do I want to use it? Do I think it's interesting and compelling? is required, at least for me to see the project through? I've started many projects, and then just been like, Oh, this is an interesting anymore. And then I I don't finish it? And yeah, so possible and interesting. Moving into hardware, I think, again, that's sort of similar. So they're really trying to say something. Oh, okay. Cool. I had the question in front of me. 

Yeah, I think then in terms of hardware implementation, it's very similar. It's, is the processing power available? Are the chips that I want to use available? Can I fit it all in the form factor that I want? All of those things, I'd say are also required, and maybe like to be a little bit more woowoo sort of vision, I think is important is, you know, required, I would say in the sensitive to we're creating new instruments is very creative practice. And so some amount of vision and creativity. Also, I would say,

# What do you consider to be the biggest challenge when designing an instrument?

If I had to pick one, I would say the process of moving from idea into product,

which is like, sort of pre from like, I think about it from like, pre production into production, right? And so ideation we have imagination is limitless, basically, like, but, you know, maybe it's limited by what we've been exposed to. But aside from that, there, it's it's, it's more or less limitless. And so I can come up with a million ideas, but like, sitting down, and, you know, going through these motions of the different prototyping phases, and sticking with it, I think, is is the biggest challenge for me, particularly because I really enjoy the ideation process. And of course, I like the troubleshooting and the figuring stuff out, but it's really it's very time consuming, of course, you know, and there's only so many hours in the day and particularly when I have a bunch of other things, you know, and i guess that's predicated by the notion that i'm starting from scratch because to be honest a lot of the instruments that i've designed have have come out of working on a piece of music and saying oh well i want this sound and then so that that then comes from necessity right and so in that sense because it's not just my imagination driving the creation of the thing it becomes i feel a little bit more necessity a little bit more energy around trying to get it done because it's part of this larger vision of work that i'm that i'm doing that's also generally true for conceptual pieces as well even if they're standalone like they're not part of a larger musical work but the conceptual pieces have sort of a more more momentum behind them but even in that case it's some combination of prototyping and motivation or you asked for one so i chose prototyping you know like sort of moving into prototyping but yeah i think motivation would be another one i would say so 

> Do you think they're related, though, that the relationship is that if the prototyping is arduous motivation, there's a trade off? On not necessarily,

yeah if i if i if i if i'm going through an arduous process that are not seeing a lot of reward like if you know for instance i just keep coming up against like oh this thing isn't supported on a platform i'm using yet or like this chip is too new and they're you know or or this language doesn't have the support that i need or whatever you know and it just keeps i keep hitting roadblocks

usually i'll try to find another easier way to do the same thing if it's possible but yeah 

# What tools do (or could) play the biggest part in helping with these challenges?

yeah i'm just thinking like the thing that helps me the most is remembering that i'm typically more oriented toward instant gratification and that like things like patience and mindfulness tend to help be with the challenge of motivation and sort of dealing with this process i think experience is also really helpful you know and and especially working with someone who is experienced and who can say if i'm if i'm working on a team or i have a mentor someone saying like yeah you know this is this is tough maybe try a shortcut here or like nobody's done this before so it's going to be hard sort of like these mental preparations for that i think are really helpful and in that sense i guess i would say a technological tool is like i mean places like lines and message boards are resources where they're people who are actively working on these things and we share ideas and talk about them in a way that is you know allows for for both emotional sympathy as well as technological technological help because it's yeah i mean it's work right and it's an almost all of these things have been passion projects i've done i've done a few designs for for you know like bespoke artworks or you know i've been i've been commissioned to to design sounds for you know video and film and all these things too but when it comes to instrument design most of the time it's the passion project or something to expand on my own work and so because of that the passion is sort of the main motivating factor or curiosity or you know whatever that artistic drive is that i have within myself and so like finding community being able to find community around those things and also inspiration you know finding resources for people that are doing things i never would have thought thought of helps to motivate me to push through and be like well if this is the first time somebody is trying this and it's going to be tough and

or even just like yeah

trailblazing and prototyping and all these things it's like we're gonna fail a lot and so that i went constellation leaks you know some emotional constellation of people being like yeah this is tough you know what you're doing is hard and and even i find that even though i consider myself rather experienced in the field of electronic instrument design i think i'm also constantly pushing my boundaries around like oh well i've never done this before maybe i can try this and this will you know create a new way this will inspire a new way for me to interface with sounds you know and so seeing other people do that and hearing about their experiences is also a fantastic thing.

# How would you define a DMI?

yeah it's sort of like the platonic ideal of a digital instrument right it's sort of like what are the i guess again it comes down to boundaries you know yeah i mean it's so you've got like a digital control the oscillator could be it could be argued that that's still amad that that the integrator or like the circuitry itself that's awesome that's that's making the sound in in in analogue some digitally controlled analogue circuitry you know is that digital or analogue it's somewhere in between right so maybe i would say like really nit picky about it because ultimately i think it's it's an instrument that is primarily comprised of digital components or uses digital components in some aspect of its have its functioning yeah it's hard to say i'm just i'm trying to think of what it isn't right and so is there a good a good sound like a like a good sentence in there do they use a sentence that you can use or should i try to like have some sort of summary

okay

yeah okay

yeah i would say a digital instrument is an instrument that uses digital components for its function and that can be digitally controlled something it can be digitally synthesised it can be entirely digital plugins and all these things
i also one caveat there is i don't know if that like i think the definition is interesting i don't know if it's super important to me because i'm also like you know is is recording to tape or to computer better like all these different questions i'm like well it's you know the instrument part is the thing that's most important to me and also like the least contested i think right now anyway

> How important is the musical part?

extremely i think it's it's the only like i guess that's inherent for me and the definition of instrument is like that it's that it is musical and i think you know i i witness a lot of digital tools for music making that are may not necessarily be performative you might be able to programme them for music and to be also to still be able to create music with them and so i would still consider them instruments i just think that the the chosen interface is it's it's it's not as immediate right it takes more planning or more i don't know but the word is i'm looking for but yeah i would say i think musicality whether it's programmed or performed is vital is like so so important

yeah

# What concepts do you consider a DMI to be made up from?

oh, interesting, interesting yeah well because a digital musical instrument is a synthesis of these different concepts so you have an instrument which is something that's used to do something and then musical isn't so it's it's an instrument that's used to create music and then digital would be so that uses ones and zeros some sort of memory storage and things like that right and so yeah in a way it's it's it's in the name i think there's so many different examples of how that can be executed and some of them are good and some of them are bad but i think at the end of the day yeah it's it's you know it's a tool used for making music that uses digital

components

> so you can dig in a little bit, because I get it that's interesting to look at it in the literal sense of the words that comprise it. The the instrument bit. What is that achieving conceptually, in its role? is the same for all these components.

yeah good

question so i think in of those three terms that's the one that's most about execution and use right and so you can have a good instrument or a bad instrument for any given job and so this instruments job is to create music right so like a hammer is an instrument for pounding nails and you can have good hammers or bad hammers depending on what you're trying to do if your nails are really tiny or your walls very fragile or whatever don't use a sledgehammer right and so in a way i think the instrument part of digital musical instrument is that it's a tool meant to be used to create music through digital means and that the the execution of that music is the priority there that's the thing that could be elegant or elegant i think is what, yeah.

> And so again, conceptually the musical part. Like how do you see that plays into the the instruments design? Do you know? So? Of course, like, we were familiar with Western traditional music, or, you know, if you've been in orchestras, particularly, you'd be very familiar with that. But, what, what conceptually, can we break out from the musical component there?

yeah i think that for me is about translation because music in general you know i'm a composer i studied classical and like sort of standard notation composition 20 century composition in my undergraduate and for me the composition is about translation whether it's feeling or idea or to some extent semiotics or you know sort of symbolism and these sorts of things but for me personally at least musicality is about being able to translate feelings and emotions sensations to to up to a sonic artwork and so i guess ideally an instrument that effectively allows that process to be efficient and most ideally the instrument gets out of the way you don't even realise that you're playing a guitar you're just it's just about expressing the music right and so i think that's the musical part for me is about being able to be art articulate about i'm using the word in the definition which is why i'm stuttering because i'm trying to say like we have a definition of what music is we all know what music is and so the musical aspect of that of digital musical instrument is that it's an instrument designed to facilitate most efficiently the process of creating that music.

# Any other comments?

i think i've talked about like my main goals in digital musical instrument design are to be immediately expressive and use the reason i choose to make digital musical instruments as opposed to analogue you know i've studied a bit of instrument building and and and you know played more traditional instruments and the reason i use the digital realm is because of its possibilities because of how it's it's sort of it's new territory it's been explored and but they're they're constantly new things Done. And there's a lot of potential and also because from a purely expressive standpoint, the potential for possibilities in being musically expressive, exists very widely in digital music. Because we right now we're using digital tools to capture music and to disseminate and reproducing music that is extremely expressive and powerful. And so I guess my connection, my thought is that what can we also use input into digital systems to, to create expressive music in a way that utilises all of the available possibilities for sound? You know, from sort of from a from a kg and perspective, you know, we can we can create and to some extent manipulate what am I trying to say I had it for a second timeout cage, and sort of the universality of sound, right, and I feel like digital tools most effectively capture the universality of sound and its potential. And so digital musical instruments for me, are about being able to access and manipulate that entire universe of sound that exists in the digital realm, which right now only primarily seems to be focused on recording playback, and some to some extent manipulation. But I think I just see an artist untapped, mostly untapped potential for new ways to use the sonic possibilities of the digital world and to articulate them in a musical way.

Yeah, previously, you talked about essentials in design. And something that I forgot to talk about was ergonomics, which I think is really important. It's hard for an instrument to be useful, if it isn't ergonomic. For instance, if one of the reasons I've avoided modular synthesisers by and large is because it's an nest of cables on top of the interface. And so in order it just all this stuff, you know, I think I think they sound brilliant, I think that a lot of the functions are really interesting. But one of the things that I'm working on is a performance interface for modular synthesis. So that you can have an ergonomic interface that's made for the hands, all the controls are right there in front of you. And then you connect to that to the very organised animal accessible modular faceplate. And I'm actually also interested in using digital tools to design CV interface, like CV control surfaces. So like, the most basic would be things like the bucola or Serge touch keyboards, you know, and then sort of the innovations that have come off of that. But most of them are like, super flat. And, you know, on these on these hard grids, and the hand, like the mind can can sort of deal with grids well, but only if they're a certain size. Once they get to be too big, we lose sight of landmarks that we need colours or other shapes. And so I think cognition and ergonomics, particularly related to scale are really important for for aspects of instrument design, and digital tools, in particular, are flexible enough to be able to allow ergonomics to be a equal player in in the role of design. And it's a innovation space in instrument design that I haven't seen executed very well honestly. I've seen a lot of a lot of really interesting software and hardware innovations, but in terms of performativity, performativity, and ergonomics I've seen very little. And so that's something that I think is really important.
