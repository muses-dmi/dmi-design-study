# Why do you use your chosen programming language(s)?

So I guess these days I use mostly supercollider to design to design my instrument and my interfaces and the performances. So like the core of all the performances will happen in supercollider. So I guess like to respond to how did I come to use them? I guess I started more from like pure data. I mean, I should have written that also in the list, but I don't use it anymore. But yeah, I started by pure data, I guess. Because like, it's very accessible when you're not like a programming when you're like starting to try to programme or do things that are not afforded by like your regular DAW. So yeah, and I guess, like the visual programming at first. And also, I went to university in Ohio, and there were classes in Python and in pure data. So I guess, like, the fact that I was exposed to those things at school, like made it easy for me to use them in my projects as well. So Python, I used a library that was designed by someone who was teaching it then. So it's like a Python library for sound called Pio. So I use that like a little bit during my studies, but then I didn't use it that much afterwards. So and I guess my first performances were more sample based. And Max, like, it was really easy to work with Max for that. I was not doing like more complex sound design or synthesis. So it was more like kind of a forking of different sections. And just like, yeah, creating more the progression. And I guess, like, the reason why I shifted to super collider. And the reason why I'm really interested in that right now is because it's like, super flexible, it's also like code based, which I prefer, like, like, text based. And, and also, like, it's very powerful to do synthesis, which, like, you know, is a very important part of my practice. 

# Why do you use your chosen tools for instrument design?

So I guess, when I started, what was easier I guess to design like, because I was not familiar with 3d. It was easier for me to sort of take the How can I say it's not really assembling but I will describe it like that. Like, instead of instead of like creating a 3d object, like I would just, you know, assemble it and then laser cut it with, like, accurate pieces. You know, that was my, my approach to doing 3d stuff because I did have access to 3d software. And also, I guess, because of the fab labs that I'm involved in, and like that was, I guess, a Montreal and I guess in many cities, like, the DIY scene is sort of what you go through at first, when you start designing instruments like that, and when you don't necessarily have a background in industrial design. So yeah, so I started with just like tools, that's even easier for me. And also, like, laser cutting is like a 2d thing. So I didn't have to do any 3d. So that was a good entry point. And yeah, like the Fab Labs, in Montreal, were sort of my way in. And then like, from getting into those communities. And also with like, people around me there, were also interested in like, doing 3d stuff and whatnot. I learned about different software. And then, like, I think I use sketchup a bit at first, but it was not like for, for doing more precise, 3d modelling, I found that like, fusion 360, which is has a free version, which is very good. I used to, I used to use all kinds of crack software, but I sort of phased out of that. And now I use mostly like, the few things that I use, I buy them so. So this one has a free version. And also, like I mentioned openscad, which is like this open source 3d software that I sort of happen to know the guy who programmed it. So it was just like, Oh, you did that? Okay, cool. I'll just like fiddle with it. And then I use that to design. So that was more through community. Yeah. And then like, of course, like, I think in any community, you will always have like people who are more like, tech savvy. So by talking to those people, I will just, like, get a review of all the new cool stuff that I could try if I needed to. So I guess yeah, it's through community. And like, I mean, I I, I do like using tools that are up to date and new, but I'm maybe not like, as other people like looking for all of the new newest developments and all of that. So yeah, so that's what I use these days. Yeah, fusion 360. And now like, I started doing more videos, so I guess like touchdesigner is sort of the easy entry point. And the one that is like, largely promoted, I guess so. Yeah. Summing up, community. And, yeah, that's it. And free stuff.

# Why did you chose your chosen platform(s) to build your instrument on?

Yeah, well, I mean, right now, so I'll just give you a little overview. I'm using Mac, but it really like, I use Mac for my personal computer. But I have a really old computer. And like probably if I'm doing this switch soon, I might not continue with lag. So. And also one thing that's important, most of I didn't mention also I use Raspberry Pi very often. So like on that I run Linux obviously, which like supports supercollider, it is no problem. So and so it depends on the project. Yeah, and now like I'm designing a new project, and I'm going to build a computer for that project. And it's going to be PC, but like the operating system, but

so

I guess as I as my practice develops, like I have more access to resources that allow me to branch out and use like the right platform for the project. And also to have like, it's, it's it's interesting in a way, but like having more resources, allow me to have a better overview of how to optimise a certain system, person and project. So yeah. Yeah, so I guess like in this case, like, sometimes I will buy another computer just for the performance, or I will build something. So most of the time, though, if that still answered your question, the core is still running on a separate computer. Like it's rare that I'll have all of the code of the instrument running solely like on a small microcontroller or a Raspberry Pi. Like most of the time, I'll have like my master computer that runs most of the things yeah, cuz there's very often many elements like the video the sound that come together.

Yes.

Yes. So I hope that answers the question. 

> To summarise, so you pick the OS for the master computer absed on requirements?

Yeah, now I'm moving towards that more and more. But I guess like at first Mac was just like the thing that was again in the community. Now there's a shift also in the community away from MAC for many different reasons. So again, like it's a community based thing, but also like for the affordances of those things, like my roommate and colleague, now a switch to Windows and he told me that like the ports, those the audio ports on Windows on yet on windows are just like, really complicated. And he's not doing this really traditional stuff. So like the, the way that sound has been designed on Mac is really good. So I guess that's why like, so many musicians use that. Yeah, so it depends on the project. And then, but I tried more and more to do do stuff that are specific to the project, like I've used, as I said, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino. But now like, more and more, I'm interested to sort of like, bypass Arduino and just like programme my own microcontrollers, or just like, kind of optimise things, but I guess that comes with like, yeah, the experience of having worked with those tools like Arduino for a long time.

# Are there any other tools (software or otherwise) that you feel contributes significantly to your process?

I'm going to mention, I don't know, like X-IO, like it's, yeah, cuz, cuz like, it's, it was a really easy way for me to start doing Wi Fi interfaces. And like I, I still, like, just recycle them in my projects. I mean, they're quite expensive. But yeah, like I they're very efficient and like, finding ways to optimise Wi Fi is really not something that I'm interested in. *Laughs* And so it was good to to use that tool for that.

> Is wi fi quite a big part of your instruments?

Yeah, yeah, I did like to prod to bigger projects that use Wi Fi Wi Fi interfaces. So yeah.

# What would be the biggest 'Quality of Life' improvement you could request from your tools for designing DMI?

Yeah, I saw that question. And I, I don't have an answer for you. Because Yeah, I don't have an answer for you. There's nothing like really that I'm just like, Oh, this is really frustrating. I wish this could do that. Because most of the time, like you find ways to bridge it, and through finding ways to bridge those gaps, you learn new techniques. So and I like that process of going through the difficulties of and also like, each platform has his idiosyncrasies that direct a bit, how are you going to use it, and I like that aspect of like, working with the code or working with a programming platform, and then like, it co constitutes to kind of work that you're going to be doing on those platforms. And like I like using for that reason, kind of like many platforms and renewing myself. So yeah, like, I don't know, there's things that maybe I'll find, like, a bit frustrating with some of them, but like, I mean, yeah, like, a lot of people, for example, say that supercollider has a, like a tough, abrupt learning curve. But you know, it's like, it's like, it has the good sides of its bad sides. So, yeah, I will say like, not not necessarily anything. Yeah.

# How do you approach the design of a new instrument?

Yeah, I'm

going to make a little introduction, that is definitely going to tint all of my subsequent answers. So I really see like, instrument design as part of the artistic process. So it's like really a holistic approach. It's not like designing a tool for me, it's really like part of the work in a way and I really see it as a spectrum, right. So so like, I don't limit it to like the physical object, if it is a physical object because for me, like building an instrument can be like building a Set of like, you can go so wide like it could be building a set of presets on a specific software, it could be like finding a way to interface like incoming sounds or data they will use and like the way that you structured that, and then the way that you

dynamize it,

which could be through gesture, or which could be through, you know, like it, but it's always like a performance, right? So it's like through actualization and performance and love that could be moving sliders on a GUI on your computer, that could be like just writing code. And so I see all of that as like, instrument design, and I kind of dislike the use of the word instrument, cuz I mean, I don't dislike it, but I see it really on the spectrum that, like, goes much beyond like, like the physical thing. So I guess like, how do I approach the design of a new instrument? Like for me, like in the performances, maybe I'll strike like that, in the performances that were more based on like something corporal and gestural interfaces, I always, like, try to find a concept that bridges outside of just a purely musical context. So it's not just about finding cool gestures that will make cool music, it's also like, embedding some kind of extra musical aspect to it that could lead to I mean, it could be anything like so show. techno cultural ideas or like something. Yeah, more socially relevant. So and then like you find, I guess, objects or ideas concept that will have some musical or gestural affordances. And then so I guess, like, that's how I approach it, I start, like, with an idea, or just like a metaphor that I like, that could like translate to music or to gesture. And from that metaphor, I just, like, try to figure out like, technically, how I how that could happen. Yeah. And in that process of obviously, like, as I said before, like the tools that you use, like will influence back and forth, like the conceptual discourse that's attached to that project, and vice versa. So like, I mean, it's limited with the, the technical aspects of it. So yeah.

# When creating a new instrument, what distinct aspects are required to realize the design and implementation?

So yeah, I mean, I do see it as as a kind of spectrum. And then you have like, all these little

polls of No, I guess of like, interests, like, if you talk about corporality, or like, okay, like, the sound the gesture, like there's those things. And then of course, like when you actually create a project, ie, you go from that kind of like vast spectrum that is very, like, continuous, and then you focus, like, I mean, in the concrete concretization of it, you will have to narrow down and like, make decisions about all of this. So yeah, it becomes more concrete through the process of actually doing it. So I guess, like, more concretely, I guess, it's like finding an object and instruments or something that will have enough afford, like, that will have a lot of possibilities. But at the same time, that it's like, it's a balance between being not too limited and too limitless. So I guess, yeah, because, like, in a way, that that's still like, I mean, I guess that's how I've done it so far. But like, I guess that leads to a certain kind of performance as well, which I'm trying to question these days. It's like, like, is a performance with interfaces supposed to be this kind of like this discovery of what this instrument can do? And I guess like this is very often how I've designed my performances so far, but like, it's something that I'm not as interested in. So I would say that like maybe you can have another instrument that is very, extremely limited and then you go into more More of a like trance inducing kind of performance. So, I mean, so there's like, yeah, the corporality, like the amount of implication of the body, like, what's the place of the body and the performance? That's something that I guess, like a distinct aspect from you that I like have to think about. And then what is what kind of movement is afforded? Like I was thinking about that. Recently, like, you can have a theatrical movement, you can have a dancer movement. So it's more like an estimate the size movement, you can have like more of an operator or like instrumentalist movements. So all of that are like different types of movements that you could use. And I guess that's a very important aspect to like, decide from which perspective, you will address it. And then obviously, there's like the sonic aspect, which is, of course, linked to the gestures that

are afforded.

Yeah, and and I mean, I mean, I will say now, but it probably will refer to other questions. But like, for me, like, continuous motion, and corporality is not necessarily a positive thing, right? In the design, like, it's just again, like part of a continuum. And like, depending on your concept, it might be really good for performance to have an interface where you just do something that does something like pressing play, but then you can press play by like, tapping on something, or you can press play by tapping a button, but that's still kind of more discreet kind of gesture. And then, yeah, and then you can have more continuous gestures that and, yeah, but but that, like, refers to the kind of music you want to do. And it's like, really linked. And I guess, yeah, and then, like, the visual aspect of creating stenography, because I really like when you can like to do so stenography from the visual concept of the instrument. So yeah, core, like the body corporality like the kind of movements that you're going to do. The Sonic aspect and the kind of temporality that is afforded by the composition, and then like the physical visual aspect of like, yeah, and what can you do in terms of sonography? 

# What do you consider to be the biggest challenge when designing an instrument?

Yeah. I mean, for me, it's always the, the tension between and integrating. I'll call them pre recorded, but it's like more predefine versus like, what's done live versus what's, like, predefined? And what is possible from the interface? So yeah, it's a bit related to the past question. But like, yeah, it's like, tension of deciding, okay, like, Okay, I have, like, I mean, and I'm going to use your your sheet saying that I can refer to specific problems. Like one thing, in the kind of performances that I've done. It's like the tension between, like, having a track in the background, and then adding kind of a gestural element on top of it. And like, this is like the easy way out. But I mean, I mean, it's not necessarily that easy, but that could be well introduced. But I guess, yeah, it's like finding a balance between that tension of like, yeah, wanting to have a development that goes beyond the affordances of a single channel movement.

And,

but still, like retaining that kind of immediacy, that like makes the corporality of the performance interesting. Yeah, and like finding ways to do that, creatively, you know, like, how can you? How can you start a background track and here I'm using quotes on purpose, how can you use like more of a supporting part in a way that doesn't feel like you're just pressing play? Or like, how can you modulate like those kind of starting things, but then modulating parts of it and all of that. And I guess, like, for me, using many different interfaces that have autonomous behaviour has been a way to deal with that. Like, and that's why also I like physical behaviour like that have entropy, like, like I design a thing with spinning tops and with the pendulum. So like, when I started, it can still like go on by itself and I don't have to like input energy at all times. And that's a way for me to sort of Like, visualise the polyphony without? Yeah, and because I mean, there's so much you can do on stage, but like that way, like the universe continued by themselves, so I can sort of like do things where you're like, oh, that progresses, but like, you know, it still has energy on its own. So that's a way in which I but that's always tricky. Yeah. 

# What tools do (or could) play the biggest part in helping with these challenges?

I'll have to think about that one for just a second. I mean, I guess like many tools could do that. But the way that I use supercollider is really like, easy for that. I mean, I've mentioned like, the use of multiple interfaces rather than just one. So I guess in a way, that is an answer to the question like the malts. Yeah. And kind of like interfaces that are multiple rather than a single object. And then he has supercollider because like I can sort of do go from micro patterning to more macro patterning and kind of like, operate with a single gesture, but on like different layers of where the meaning comes from. And the performance.

Yeah.

> Would you say it's not as much the tool as much as the approach that allows you to lift up a kind of, layer?

Yeah, definitely.

Yeah,

it's Yeah, you're right in saying like, it's not really a tool based thing, really. And it's like, really a concept. Yeah. challenging. The way we use instruments in a way? And yeah, and I mean, I guess like, I was like that quote, I think it's about Han Kim said that like that, you know, when when you're on stage, listening to electronic music, and there's somebody behind a laptop you, like, you know, that there's only so much that one person can do. And like, I mean, it's kind of like working with that paradox that, like people have been trying to do different ways to perform electronic music and like, go beyond that. So it's always like, I mean, I guess like, this is the question that is like, the base of so many experiments with with new interfaces, I guess. Yeah.

> You mentioned autonomous systems, that's quite interesting.
> particularly if you kind of combine the thought of the autonomous systems and what you mention earlier about having someone hidden away disguises something happening

I like that idea. Because, yeah, it also relates to something that I've been thinking about recently, which is kind of performativity of non human agents. And it's still performance. And I am really interested to sort of work with that kind of performance these days. It's like, recognising the performativity of algorithms or, like processes that are not in surely bodily. And so yeah, I mean, you know, in my case, in those performances, I sort of let the physical gestures with their own, like, movement that's already like, I let them form the musical discourse, but like, that could be also seen as like, some kind of algorithmic process that you launch. And then like, it does its thing. And, and like, it's still performance, like, I mean, the algorithms themselves are performing in that in that sense, and like, yeah,

yeah. Yeah. autonomy,

the autonomy of the system is a good I think it's a good way to think about it. And I mean, I'm just going to mention that also like, that aspect with like corporal versus non corporal is something that I Interested in right now like working with I don't know, avatars? Or as I said, like, not necessarily having to be there on stage and like, how do we retain that musical gesture? Or do we need to have a musical gesture? 

# How would you define a DMI?

I mean, I guess, I guess like I, for that question, I really dislike the desire to sort of categorise it for those reasons. Because like, I don't like seeing the actual music, musical instrument as a finite thing as a finite category. So, and I and, and that's super important for me, because like, there's so many things afforded by new media technologies and like, in like, just the fact that it can be sort of, like, physical and virtual at the same time. And like the kind of translation that can happen between Yeah, between that, and yeah, the performativity of things that are not human. And like, that opens up such a big range of possibilities. And I feel like it would be kind of a, there's a word in English for that. but like, like, kind of, using the tradition of, of acoustic instrument and trying too much to like, put it on what on what digital musical instrument can be. Like, I feel like that's kind of a fallacy. Like, I mean, shouldn't we instead, like, celebrate the fact that like, we've opened such a big range of space for like, this, this broad spectrum between like, yeah, physical and virtual, and like, the ways that we we can represent that are really large. And I mean, they're going to become larger and larger. I mean, you could have like a physical thing that'll represent an avatar instrument, and then like, and then like, you could represent to this video, but like, eventually, maybe we'll have other ways to kind of bridge the gap. I like on purpose, making it kind of really large. Because, yeah, I really see as beyond the finite category of physical things. But yeah, I guess it's just like, an aspect of an artistic work. And like, where there's a musical dimension? Yeah, I don't know. It's a bit too big. But I guess like, I mean, the the musical aspect is important, obviously, because otherwise they would be, they wouldn't be in it. 

# What concepts do you consider a DMI to be made up from?

I will say that

a digital musical instrument is made of a reflection on 'what it is performance'. And like, what do you want to express in the music? I think it forces that reflection. And like, kind of it forces. I mean, not it forces you because obviously a lot of people don't use that. But for me at least like it's like it's kind of an opportunity to reflect on the codified ways in which we think about when an instrument is and what music is, and how it's performed. And for me, it becomes more interesting if you kind of like, try to use a subversive approach to it. So what concept but what I mean, I think I sent them earlier, but like you can reflect on the notion of like the body, the presence or lack thereof, the kind of control or gesture, how you're going to interact. Like Yeah, the notion of interaction. Where does the human Input comes from where does it probe in the process of that kind of performativity that can happen at different layers? then yeah, the visual like material or virtual way in which it happens and this Sonic aspect.
