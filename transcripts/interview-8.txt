# Why do you use your chosen programming language(s)?

So if, if, as we discussed the it's acceptable to include kind of visual programming languages like Mac to react to this, then the main reason is that the idea itself for this current instrument came developed over using standard, you know, the shelf software instruments for a long time. And it was based originally on ideas about how to use granular synthesis. So, in granular synthesis, my kind of performance approach would be that I would write the melodic ideas for pieces of music. And then when I perform them, I would use like frozen granular position modulation to rearrange those simple melodic ideas. So, if you have like a simple kind of loop playing, and I would want to move through that in a nonlinear fashion, rearranging the order and the time dynamic of that piece of music and that would be my way to kind of reinterpret music live. And the reason I did that just quickly is because the sound design process and the kind of Sonic content of a lot of my material isn't possible to generate instantaneously in a live setting. It's a long process of re recording processing sounds, and that actual Sonic generation can't be done live. So I needed to find a way to reinterpret things. So it was that time element that I was focused on. The problem with the granular census is it's not in its nature, it's not accurate, because it has like a kind of, you know, you're taking a kind of cloud based approach to reprocessing sound. So you're taking Microsoft micro second bits, having lots of them, and getting that kind of thing that you're so granular, that kind of looseness that sort of smearing cloud of sound, which is why I wanted to move forward. So the reason I chose to use Mac's and reactor is a, it meant not learning a new actual language, and B, there were things that had been built into my existing workflow already. And the second reason with Maxim, the thing that, you know, has its issues that stands above other options is because of its integration, other existing environments. So I still use Ableton as a kind of live environment, mixing tool kind of host environment. And obviously Max has the max for live integration into that kind of existing situation. So if I were to build things in other languages, I'd need to think about that kind of host aspect as well. Whereas with Mac's, you, obviously have the built in functionality of Ableton, which even if you're only using it as a mixer or as a kind of an even as you're using it as a host just to direct it's your sound card, it still takes a percentage of that work out of the equation. So that's why I ended up with Max and reactor. And then because I was introduced to the sensor, which is the thing that actually kick started the physical kind of definition of this project as a single idea. The ability that Max has to interpret and organise that war sensors title, a raw data from the central. Also Max is supported by the developers at Central. So if you want to use kind of conventional MIDI, or any of those sort of things that's supported as well by both of those parties. But yes, that really that ability to take that raw data and then convert that into something that's like standardised for music producers, I Max for live object inside Ableton.

# Why do you use your chosen tools for instrument design?

I think in this particular project is kind of best to focus on central because it's such that hardware integration of physical gesture integration, such a game, changing elements of it. And I think if I hadn't been introduced to Central, I'd have carried on trying to find other hardware ways of implementing that idea. And it's all about the, it's all about how the gestural relationship changes, how you interact and how you kind of perceive the material that you're performing. The way as I said, that I was doing this before was using a software sample based instrument with granular capabilities. So that could have been things that made him react to omnisphere, contact any of those things where you can kind of generate your own basic, granular instruments. And then I'd use like normal MIDI knobs to kind of scrub through the sound. And it's such an natural, when you're visualising what it is to move through time. In sound, you're not nobody is visualising turning a knob. However, you visualise that experience, and however you want to relate that and whatever speed you want that to happen. Nobody ever wanted to make that event occur by turning a knob. Like it's just not useful. And the amazing thing about the combination of the sensel and Max is that you can combine so many things. So a step up in kind of in the design process from the knob, could be to use something, either to build a pressure sensitive button with some kind of modulation. And then use a slider because obviously a slider gives you the impression of moving from A to B with incremental steps in between, which is like a better visualisation of time. And then the knob gives you you know, so the button will give you that kind of idea of amplitude. So those are the two things a bit like the Platinum aren't placing on Martin. So I spent a lot of time with that as a kind of imprint in my mind of early electronic instrumentation where you have in your left hand and amplitude button, and in your right hand ribbon or the keyboard for controlling pitch or, you know, kind of monophonic keys. So as soon as the central came along, and the idea that you can combine all of those gestures, amplitude, filter modulation, anything that you can put onto pressure with that idea of moving through time, as well. All in one hand. That's like, yeah, that's a game changing gesture, which means that in, in single movements, I can move through kind of in, you know, in a fourth dimension, like through that kind of time and aesthetic dynamic of music. And yeah, that's the difference between that and a knob. 

> so its fair maybe to say that the main justification for the tools you use is having enough dimesions of expression?

Yes, but

it does definitely

differ I mean, the, you know, the kind of the advances in that dimensional expressive controllers are all around MP based controllers. And that is which still we still have the idea of linear music behind them. So they're gestural ways of playing music, the difference, it's the kind of the open ended nature of the central means it's not actually tied to a keyboard like, it doesn't require kind of linear melodic input of notation. It's some something about the nature of it is almost is freer than those kind of MP alternatives which are coming from a very much from a keyboard. No input idea. I think the, if I were to visualise this in the this instrument and another hardware version, it would be that idea of a slider with the pressure. Have you seen that that is to share or teach or touch or that kind of wooden thing? Yeah, basically that and a giant slider would be the the other hardware alternative. But yes, it's it's I don't know, gestural. poly? 

> but so also being seperate from musical culture, western msuical theory for example?

Yeah. Well, you can, it, it's any audio that you wish to move through in time. So I mean, we're jumping forward a bit to the philosophical part of it, but it's the same in I'm

in.

It could be the same in sound design, it could be the same in a moment. I think this when it first got, you know, when you first discover new senses, when you first discover freezing, or the ideas, you realise that you can take your favourite part of anything, and stay in that moment, forever, but then you quickly realise, you know, when I know at first I like poor search or whatever that actually used to require a music, the idea of getting to a place and leaving a place, it might not happen in the time that you want to tap and you might want to spend more time in one place than in another, but you still require those things because the place on its own is kind of meaningless. So that's why I wanted to build something that allowed me to, you know, move through things in the direction in the time that I wanted, but with complete fidelity, unlike granular synthesis, which is basically reprocessing. Hmm.

# Why did you chose your chosen platform(s) to build your instrument on?

Um,

I

guess I'm just stuck too much of the functionality is dependent on sitting inside another kind of environment. So and the integration so once I have this thing, you know, let's say it's whatever whatever it were to be, I still have like a multitude of internal and external processing that are rely on for my workflow in general. And they exist either inside Ableton or on the PC or on the Mac. Or inside logic upon composing. So integration within that existing environment is essential. It's not a standalone instrument. 

# Are there any other tools (software or otherwise) that you feel contributes significantly to your process?


Not in this not well. Yeah, yeah.

> perhaps in terms of sounds design as opposed to gestural stuff which we've discussed.

I mean, in the sun, I think being able to record

in

like floating in like 92 k like floating point recorder where you can record like very, very quiet very, very loud. Sounds like a recorder recorder at the beginning of this project. The Zoom, f6 thing so you can record with an enormous dynamic range and being able to use the other advantage obviously, of the sensor is that you can be in what is it called 14 bit mini 16 bit Mini. You can have higher incremental media content which is covered. But yeah, those kind of those things where you can have if you're moving slowly through time, dimension audio and you have super high fidelity content. And that's really critical, really, because you discover little things in between sounds that you know, you didn't expect.

# What would be the biggest 'Quality of Life' improvement you could request from your tools for designing DMI?


Um, I would love. I would love to be in communication with sensel and have further highway development. I mean, obviously, in this instance, unlike if, you know, trying to build a guitar or something, actually, further development of the hardware, from my end is impossible. But being able to designate the size and functionality of the hardware would be amazing. I think. I think they do have plans to integrate this into various things. I think the company is doing things with it. But um, yeah, obviously, the limitation and one of the reasons that I was nervous to express nervousness at the beginning is the idea that I'm using these off the shelf solutions. So actually, my ability to do anything to the hardware is limited. So I'm stuck with with that. I want one like five times bigger, basically. 

# How do you approach the design of a new instrument?

I thought about this,

I thought about this a lot. The first thing is the, what we discussed about programming. Even though Max is a kind of, you know, design a user friendly, designed product, and it's a visual language, and there's plenty of information online, if you're trying to learn it, I sort of thought that the process of developing would be part of the creative process, a part of the whole thing would be a sort of creative process. But actually, it's not that at all, it's an entirely different process that I've begun to realise might have been a bit of a sort of procrastination tool during lockdown. It's very, very separate. And the actual artistic or kind of creative goals that you start off with soon become lost in just the never ending pursuit of kind of technical goals, the tiny, little programming issues or whatever it is, become the kind of obsession. And actually when I finished, I was working alongside a friend. And when when we finished and decided it was completely, the last build was locked. We both entered into a bit of a spiral downward spiral about trying to remember what we're actually doing, and how to go about playing it. But I'll come back to that when we talk about what is what is a thing? I guess the characteristics are wanting to explore I like the idea of have lots of ideas coming together. So I talked about the, you know, goals that I had of kind of refining granular synthesis, so that became more specific and less cloud like, and I had this gestural idea. And then I was introduced to the, you know, to the central and all of those sort of things, suddenly show you that an idea that's been very disparate, actually, is there ready to kind of ready to kind of condense? So I guess it's just a collection of lots of different things. So you can try it for a while?

> So if that were to generalise to another instrument it woudl be the culmination of ideas you'd been building up to?

I think so because I think everybody you know, I was thinking about the name the club's the other day. The mimu of gloves. Or any of these ideas that everybody involved in electronic music is trying to do something using not quite the right tools. As a general rule, because I'm wearing so many techniques, you're using your 909 I mean, that's it. profits off the job. But in most people involved in experimental electronic music, they're they're using a keyboard to put in notes they're using, you know, like we talked about the knob to control cutoff, all of those things are, are not designed for the outcome that they're attempting to get. Most people have, you know, sounds in their head trying to achieve and that using tools experimentally attempting to achieve different things, but none of these things are built for purpose. Like that's not the design of these tools. So I guess, yeah, it would be, it would be, if I were to do something else, it would be that there was something that I were trying to achieve either physically or sonically that didn't exist at the moment.

# When creating a new instrument, what distinct aspects are required to realize the design and implementation?

Yeah.

Again, I think this one, I'll answer relatively simply because I'm using existing software and hardware. So I'm using things more or less for the intended use it therefore, I didn't have to build a new physical controller, or interface I just had to. But I did have to build the interface, but it's inside an environment that already exists. So I'm using existing tools

> if you were going to define them as distinct aspects what would they be?

I suppose. Input and input, conversion and output. Yeah, gestural input. Well, in Max, it's like, what how would you describe a dict object like a like unpacking, unpacking? You have a gestural input and conversion into sound?

# What do you consider to be the biggest challenge when designing an instrument?

I actually,

I mean, even though, well, I'd say soldering if I had to do any soldering. In this instance, even though it was a pain to get up to speed with Max, actually, it is that kind of philosophical idea of coming to the end of something and thinking, what do I actually want to do. And it's the same with, you know, slightly outside of this, but same with any aspect of electronic music, like, you can teach somebody how to use Ableton in a day, you can teach somebody how to use Mac's in a week, or two weeks. And all of these things, and somebody could build the most, you know, complex, new device, but actually, what are you, what are you trying to do is the is the hardest thing, I think, because otherwise you become completely obsessed with the technical nature of it, and it loses its, its meaning, I had the idea like running through, running through this with the idea of how to try and learn counterpoint basic counterpoint at the same time, and those ideas of things kind of running in tandem, but outside of time, outside of linear time became the sort of philosophical obsession behind the whole project. And, and that idea really drove how the interface was designed, and how the physical sort of just for nature, it was designed. And I think without that, this would have stopped being something and becomes something else becomes something else. Because you're always, you know, there's endless new technologies and new ideas, and especially when you're using something with a bigger user base as Max, as soon as you come up against a problem, you had to align. And you see other people have begun these different ways there is introducing these things. There was like, you know, whatever the, the multi order, there was not much but anyway, like, you know, there's all these new advances endlessly. And technology's fascinating. So you end up going down endless streams, unless you have a really clearly defined sort of philosophical idea behind your thing that I think you forget what it is, and never finish it.

> So the challenge becomes staying directed?

Yeah, staying directed and staying to Yeah, your design.

# What tools do (or could) play the biggest part in helping with these challenges?

I already think all in their nature, all the software tools probably lie on the negative side of the previous point that was made there. There's that whole idea of artistic limitations being a sort of thing that we should embrace. They're, they're the opposite of that there's, there's, if I compare the kind of capabilities of my studio now software to any other time in, in my experience of doing this is it's extraordinary. And you know, what we, there's endlessly changing, I think the idea of embracing physical limitations is a good thing. And that's why narrowing yourself down to developing a hardware interface is a really good idea. Again, it's difficult for me to say because I'm not building something from scratch. And if I was, it would be a much more clearly defined approach, because I'd had to have actually, literally designed the hardware interface. But I think, you know, tying myself to the central, and allowing that to define the project was really the biggest help. 

# How would you define a DMI?

Yeah, I thought about this a lot. the idea you know, you could make an argument for it being changing a preset on a synthesiser is actually a valid argument. I have, there's an argument I have quite regularly with a friend, about the sort of, like physical excellence we associate with classical music, and how that's never really been embraced by electronic music. And if you take a pianist, even a, you know, not even somebody who's a concert pianist, or someone who wants to get better, they're gonna be playing for an hour or two hours every single day, for their entire life. And I don't know anybody in electronic music, who does one defined limited action for two hours a day, for 20 years. I mean, you think they were insane? Like, you know, I, I just play with this filter for two hours a day. So I want to be the absolute master at like tweaking this filter. But that ethos still stands. And his argument on the flip of it, is that there's so many people involved in electronic music, that it's kind of like a hive, pushing technology and pushing ideas forward. But I still think that that idea of refining your, your practice practices in your practice, in pig terms, refining your practice, and making it something that you can get better app is what would me define what you're calling digital music instruments. So the thing with this instrument that I love, and the reason that I consider that it falls into your category is because it's so gestural that I can put four parts into it, the parts, the constituent parts for tune, and I can play them in any different way. And it is something that actually requires hours of practice before you nail it. And in every other part of I mean, you can record the meeting, but it's very clunky. And every other part of electronic music, my process is designed to make up for my musical inadequacies. So I can smash himself in on a keyboard, I can go and edit that I can process it, I can endlessly refine things. But actually, with this instrument, it's an instantaneous thing that requires practice, in order to refine in order to get better, like a conventional instrument, and I think that element, for me would be the kind of borderline between the two things would be what allows it to fall into the category of being an actual instrument.

> does the digital aspect play much of a role in that defintition?

Yeah, because it's because the sonic output of the instrument is anything that you want it to be, and obviously that's not possible with a physical instrument. So that changes the way you do it. It could be voices, it could be recordings, it could be stringed instruments. The The, the output of it is anything you want it to be this skill is about manipulating time as like an emotional, you know, parameter in the performance?

# What concepts do you consider a DMI to be made up from?

Well, I would just say, um, it would require a physical interface.

> Just a physical interface?

Just Yeah.

Yeah. Well, I mean, a physical interface, and then elements of that of the previous answer. So elements of it being a defined limited thing that one can practice at and improve that. 

> what abou the outputs mentioned previosly, is that required concept?

So you mean, does it even require sound? Yeah, I suppose it? I suppose. It? No. No, not really, because, um, well, I think I think this is entering into another into another range realm. But ever since I started playing with this thing, I was trying to incorporate it into some game design that I'm working on as well. And as soon as you're in VR, manipulating audio, and time and visual elements, then those kind of boundaries become even more blurred as well. So I think, I think, even though it's probably a bit too vague for your study, I say the idea, really, the only thing that I can be 100% certain on is that it needs to be something that's limited, and that you can improve that over time. ...And has a physical interface.

> So are you elluding to being able to perform with visuals or lights perhaps?

Yeah, already. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, even that physical interface, there's a company in Bristol, a haptic research company that had building these non existent

button using a so what's the physical interface even? I suppose that is still a physical interface. 

> So even if the output isnt audio, do you think that the concept of output is still required?

Yes, because yeah, I suppose Well, in that case, I suppose yes, it's better to refine it in that. It requires not necessarily the physical manifestation of but it requires gestures to relate to an output. An action to recruit an action to cause an event. Because otherwise, yeah, otherwise, what is it isn't anything?

Um,

but then what,

like,

what is it by then? Yeah, I guess it's the same way that we don't sit and listen to like a player piano. I mean, I guess maybe someone would, but you know, you wouldn't or like a robotic violin or anything. You want an element of humanity transferred gesturally into an appreciable event?
