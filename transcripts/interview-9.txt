# Why do you use your chosen programming language(s)?

Oh and well, Well, the biggest problem in musical products design, at least in embedded music products is cost. And so I would say that probably everyone uses C, or c++, in any higher level languages are just not used because you can't put a real fast Intel, or even a real fast cellphone processor in a music product. Or if you do, it's going to be very expensive product. And the industry is very cost sensitive. In fact, in the early days of my early machines, I used only assembly language. But then C finally became barely fast enough around for embedded processors around the 1990s. So I would say that, pretty much everybody just uses C, with a lot of optimization of loops and things like that. In my current products, I usually do much of the code to start with, but I'm not good enough and don't have enough the time to really do the refinements. It really takes someone who lives and breathes code. And I have a guy named **** And he actually works at ****, but in his spare time, he does the code for my instrument product. And so when I first ship the instrument, I got it. Before I ship it, I got the code working in basic form. But then he took over and made it much, much better. So he's sort of my partner in development.

> right and so you really boil it down to just one element here which is cost?

Yes, and particularly now that music products need to compute sound, it needs a lot of processing power to do that, if you're processing a lot of sounds at once, for example. And so in this, you're doing something very simple, like a general MIDI keyboard, where you just buy a chip that does that, then you need to write code to do that. And you don't have a fast Intel processor to work with, you've usually got something like an ARM Cortex, processor of some sort, which just doesn't have the power. And it's just necessary. When you're making music products. Of course, we don't have the volume that laptop makers have, or desktop computer makers have, or even cell phone makers have. So that's why so much music software is written for standard computing devices. But there are cases where you need to have embedded control. And my current product linnstrument is an example of that because the human interface, the tip we use often with computers but also with dedicated hardware synthesisers. And so you need to have a processor in that and you need to make sure it isn't too expensive. And even as much as I control costs, the volume of sales for a product such as Linnstrument, which is this sort of currently small market of expressive control is not sufficient to be able to use economies of scale to sell tonnes and tonnes of them for low costs. So I I'm in this in between market space, which I find personally satisfying, but is more difficult to sell things at an affordable price.

# Why do you use your chosen tools for instrument design?

I would say the biggest change since I started making instruments 40 years ago, is that I do everything in the 3d model before I make any physical materials. My particular model of choice is called Rhino 3d rhinoceros 3d. And I like it because it it's very flexible and has just about all Import Export formats. So I can work with anybody's files or send the files in a particular format. But so if I make a product now, and I would say the products that the recent products that I've done, that are were all done in 3d were my list of materials. Then a product called Tempest that I made with an old friend of mine named Dave Smith who's famous for analogue synthesisers. And in both those cases, I created the entire product, except for, of course, the details of circuit boards in the 3d model, so I was able to get everything to fit, and work on the design and make a lot of renderings that allowed me to get good feedback, before even cutting metal or wood or circuit boards.

> do you do anything to bring that model into a physical space where you can work with teh interaction with it?

Well, what I, my personal style is all others usually start in in a 2d design to draw up the arrangement of controls, and displays. So that and I put on me my musicians hat and say, I'm playing music, what do I want fast access to? What do I want? What information do I need to see quickly? And what are the size of things, all these human interface elements, I try to work out. And then I just display it on the screen. And sometimes I'll just lay the screen flat, and have it be a real size and pretend to play it and see how well my hands work with the arrangement of the controls. And then I do that usually in Adobe Illustrator, because it's it's very fast tool for 2d work. And then once I have that arrangement of controls, right, then I just import that into Rhino. And, and extrude the controls instead of the 3d shapes, and then start working with it in that way. And and then the once I know what the practical arrangement of controls is, then I'm able to say how do I take that arrangement controls and make it pretty, and something that people would be excited about buying? And then how much functionality can I get in the minimum space. So those sort of constraints. But I tend to be what some might call a top down designer, I start from the outside with musicians needs the musicians desire and in a proper human interface for for his intended purpose of making music, and then just drill down to the inside. Whereas some designers will start start with a novel circuit, and then a circuit board, and then towards the end, or at least towards the middle, they'll start thinking about human interface issues. You know, there were a lot of companies early on, they've gotten better now. But there were a lot of companies early on, where the marketing would say, we need these features, the customers are telling them we need these features and engineering would make the underlying circuitry that would do that. And then it often seemed as though they would just make a button for each requested feature, which didn't really make any sense no one really thought it through. And I think that's the I think the emphasis on design has increased over the years, largely as a result of companies like Apple, who really focused on user interface design, and usability and user experience.

> yeah, so mostly that process is virtual until you actually make it?

That is correct. I these days, I don't have to iterate physical prototypes, I because I find that by showing people pictures of it, you know, some chosen customers, and then working with myself and I am a musician too. So I have experience in this, I'm able to come up with something that makes the most sense, at least to the point that if there are changes after that, they can be incorporated in the software, by the repurposing of a button or a control or redrawing displays on a LCD display, which is easy enough to do and if you need to re label the panel. That's easy enough, whether it's a silkscreen, or it's the printing on to the buttons or things like that.

# Why did you chose your chosen platform(s) to build your instrument on?

Well, you know, what everyone in this industry tries to do is of course, leverage the economies of scale for particular parts. So for example, everybody these days is you Arm parts, you just can't get a better deal. There are so many free tools. You know, at one point, there was a company in English company that made a set of development tools for arm that was around $4,000. And I didn't, I would just use the open source tools in the market, because I just don't have that much money. And so, but at the time, there were, I guess the the open source tools weren't as well developed for embedded firmware development, but arms, it's much easier. The other thing too is is mature operating systems are easy to use it, you can actually use embedded Linux and a product. And it's practical, and it's not too expensive. And the Linux builds these days are very efficient. So they take up very little of the processors time, compared to the actual application that's running. So more and more products are just embedded Linux. So in a sense, whereas products used to be embedded and you had to write all the code or just, if you wanted to save to a flash memory, you had to grab somebody open source, save the flash memory code, or a ua a UI library, and integrate those in and sometimes they wouldn't quite fit. These days, you will just take an embedded Linux build. And you can use build route or one of these tools to just build your own minimal Linux build based on what you need. And then it doesn't really matter on the outside, it may take a second or more to boot up. But people don't know they just know they have a working product. Oh I one thing I should add to that is in my linnstrument series. A it's it's a very flexible series and attracts a flexible product. It's a I don't know if you've seen it, but it's a human interface the so for an instrument. One of the problems is it's so it's such a new idea and so flexible, but a lot of people want to make it into the Roland ideal instrument. So early on, I decided to make the software open source. And I wanted to make open source development as easy as possible. So I use the Arduino development system. So when someone buys linnstrument, and they want to edit the source code, I have the source code all available on my website. And all they do is is download and install the Arduino integrated development environment. Yeah, I D E, and then select the particular Arduino card that is instrument is emulating, which is there, do a card which is an 84 megahertz arm, m three Cortex M three, they just select that load in the source code, make the edits they want, and then shoot it to the instrument. And the ID thinks it's it's talking to a a Arduino do a, so I use the Arduino system in there as well. And that gives the advantage of people modifying their instrument. My software developer **** says that, in his opinion, this is the modern day equivalent of taking your guitar or violin to a craftsman to adjust the action or adjust the the wolf tones or our dead notes on it in some ways, or just the bridge or any of these other things. And so these days, because there is such a large DIY culture, people found it very attractive. And in fact, I would estimate that 20% of my sales for linnstrument have increased 20% because the software is open source.

# Are there any other tools (software or otherwise) that you feel contributes significantly to your process?

Yes, Arduino is a big part of that I wrote all the original code in the Arduino IDE. And *** uses a different editor. It's his preference of editor because he works fast and what he's able to use are certain other things within the operating system that worked well for him. But it's this year, other than that tools of Mt. I'd say I've tried other renderers at times. But right now, the render that's in Rhino actually I find to be very good and it's very fast for the quality it has. And the nice thing is is it's very tightly integrated so I can work quickly with it. You know, a lot of people that work in 3d. This is all I do for a living. They work all day. In 3d and, you know, they're, they're contracted to create a 3d model of a product that someone's drawn up on a napkin or something like that. Or they're doing architecture or other things that require 3d modelling. And they know every inch of that, or they every aspect of the 3d modeller, for me, it's just one of many tools I use, and many things have to do in my work day. So I mainly just want something as fast to use, and I don't want to have to learn some other renderer and figure out how to import the pre rendered files into it or out export from it. So I just like the one package, I can draw it up. And if I want to add a feature, I put it in, hit render, and in a few minutes, it's done.

# What would be the biggest 'Quality of Life' improvement you could request from your tools for designing DMI?

Well, I'm in a quest, and I think in in various aspects of life to have the tools disappear. For example, software development, I'm a fan of the no code movement. One tool I use, are to backtrack, I would say one thing, it's important to my small business, which consists of only me with a bunch of subcontractors and sub crowded manufacturing, subcontracted manufacturing and shipping is my website. It's very important to communicate all the things that people would normally ask repeatedly. And so it's it's important to have a very full website with lots of information, particularly for Lisbon, which is a very deep product can be used in a variety of ways. So I don't use HTML code. I've never really learned HTML code, or any of the other things like CSS, I just don't have the time, but I don't want to deal with it. And to me, it always seemed stupid to write code to do things graphically. So I use graphical tools, my current tool is called web flow. And it's a graphical design environment that's entirely web based. And it works out very well. Before that Adobe had a product called muse. And I must have been about six or eight years ago, they introduced this. And they did a huge marketing promotion, saying that this is the end of coding and, and we're going to change websites forever. So I thought, okay, I believe them, they're a big company, they're not going to go out of business, they wouldn't discontinue a product like that, after creating market like that. And as you're probably aware, they decided at one point to just discontinue the product. And there is just fury on the web about it. And people that started the business that made a bunch of sites for people based on a tool that Adobe just decided wasn't worth their effort. So there's a huge amount of hatred towards Adobe. And I had already created a website with about 120 pages and Adobe news, and had to throw it all away. And then, so I went, I searched the alternatives and website was up and coming. And they had some good investment. And I like what they do, it seems to be all organised. And this case I needed, I just didn't have the time. So I hired somebody to create the basic website. And then now I maintain it myself. The trouble with web flow is it still requires that you know about the HTML and CSS principles. So you can't just move something on a page, you just have, you have to know that something on the page that you want to do requires this HTML logic. And they have a one on one correspondence between the graphical object and the HTML object that it's made graphical. So I can't do everything on it. But I can do most of what I want. And I had my web helper, give me a bunch of example pages that I can use just to cut and paste from. But to me, it's, it's it's stupid, that it's like the early days of the word, store word processor, you had to learn all these silly commands to type text. And it makes no sense. And it's just it shows you how, in many ways, the software industry is just backwards. And a website is should be about design. So I would say in in so many aspects of software development, coding, you shouldn't have to do, you shouldn't be able to focus on design, particularly websites. You know, you can have objects, you just load in pre made objects, and then you just do your design. And I think that day is coming but it's not here, yet. 

# How do you approach the design of a new instrument?

well, it's

my processes is probably different than most companies, often, they got a lot of mouths to feed, and they want to hit this wider market as possible. It's not by choice, probably to the detriment of my income. But if I was smart, I'd be making much of reissues of my early machines and selling them at some sort of a healthy profit. But it just doesn't interest me. And so what I tend to do are things that I think, are new tools for the future of creating music, as opposed to the past. And so that's was the idea behind the linnstrument is I, as an example, is I looked around and I listened to the music that was being made. And I noticed that all this electronic music was being made with on off switches. Or basically, I think there were three user interface elements that were being used for the design of musical instruments. And I noticed these were all things that were originally developed for data entry, and they are on off switches, knobs, and sliders. They were never intended to be musical instruments. And if you look at all acoustic instruments, there are no equivalents of knobs, sliders and buttons on them. I mean, they're an electric guitar has a volume knob that makes sense, I think it's a very good user interface for controlling the volume or a single tone parameter, for example. But the neck of the guitar has no on off switches, and you can play it lightly, you can play it hard, you can get a variety of different tones out of it. And I also noticed, concurrently in three aspects of music in the world, that he was turning from foreground music music, specifically listened to it instead becoming background music. three examples of this are in popular music. There are no more instrumental solos in electronically produced music. You may have seen the page on my website that discusses this. It's but there used to be in instruments in music in popular music created with acoustic or electrified acoustic instruments, and instrumental so long jazz had a sax solo or in Django Reinhardt's band they had not only guitar solo, violin solo jazz, violin solo, in rock music, there was usually a guitar solo and country music, there was a pedal steel solo or a fiddle solo, there was always an instrumental so because the public like this, they like this alternative voice. The trouble is, when the music when music started to be produced with electronic tools, you didn't have the same interest in the instrumental voices because all the notes are being played by on off switches on a keyboard. And that's good for many things, but not so much for interesting compelling solo foreground voices. I think most instrumentalists they provide us with the closest approximation of the human voice and all the qualities it has to add interest in variation over time. So I noticed that this the first example was the popular music, there was no there were no more instrumental solos. And the focus was always the singer. The instrument the electronics was being used for the background for the singer. A second example is in music for picture. This music was focusing on being background for the foreground, which was the picture. And the third case is music for dance. Music is a lot of sequences, a lot of non varying tempo, a lot of non varying dynamics, being used as a background for dance for dance music, and of course, there's always dance music. But even in earlier areas, the mind arrows the mind like big band music, they was danceable music, but you always had solos in there for instrumental proficiency demonstrating instrumental proficiency. And so what I see now in the marketplace of music, either in more artists in music or in popular music is a complete lack of modern day equivalents of instrumental artists, like Miles Davis or Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix or saffron. Capelli people like that. You have DJs and you have people who are very good about preparing music, in the same way of composing, they prepare sequences that they can then they press a button and plays, but there is less proficiency in performing in real time. And it's no wonder because there's not much you can do other than to press the note and turn it on and, and release the note and turn it off. And so my motivation in creating an instrument was a personal motivation to provide a better human interface to the tools, electronic music

sounds, so that artists would not have their musical skills, so dramatically limited by this poor human interface. And so I guess a long answer to a short question is I was looking to provide a solution to what I perceived as a problem for creators, talented creators of music. As opposed to just looking for a market segment. You know, it's like the Steve Jobs quote that he lifted from somebody says, If you asked people what they wanted in a car, at the door, it was something along the lines of that. If you ask people what they want, the car does say they wanted a faster horse. It doesn't make any sense. And sometimes I think what the designers role is to listen to needs, and not necessarily give people exactly what they're asking for, but look, behind their worth to see what they need to do. And what's a better way to do that. And I think the measure of how successful you are in that is, if your customers tell you, you know, this isn't what I wanted, but it turns out what I need. And then that's what I think the designers role is.

# When creating a new instrument, what distinct aspects are required to realize the design and implementation?

ah,

money. I guess it's money, the tools, the knowledge of the tools. I mean, I think it's like any business, you have people who do the marketing, and they're supposed to find out what people want, you have people doing the designing of the product. And they're trying to find out how to make something that people want for a good price. And it's just familiar with all this. And they already know all those things that either makes a successful product or not a successful product. I'm in a lucky position. because we start off this way, I'm in an unlucky position. And I'm making products for musical instrument industry, which is a very difficult industry because people have no money, particularly these days. They don't want to pay anything they are used to paying in the low hundreds of dollars for a product. And they complain if you make something that cost more than that is often the case. Not with everybody. But it's often the case people say you've got this linnstrument, it has some buttons with it with lights in it, why can't Why does that cost the same as this other thing I have that has buttons and lights in it, they don't really know the difference. And I don't really care about those customers as much as the people who recognise the difference. But I would say it's, it's a recognition of all those tools. The advantage that I have, is I have made these things for many years. So I've developed a number of skills. And so I tend to make things in the way that I found to be most effective. For example, I use elements in the design that are easy to fabricate with a lot of without high upfront costs. For example, my instrument or the tempest device with a Smith or my adrenaline pedal that I made in the in the early 2000s. These all use sheet metal or existing metal cases, in the case of adrenaline, but sheet metal doesn't require high upfront fabrication costs as a moulded plastic case, wood for example, or even a moulded metal case, which is very expensive. And I use some wood wood is also easy to fabricate, it costs more per piece, but it costs much less. In upfront costs, circuit boards, there's not a lot you can do with and then this would had I had to spend a number of years creating a custom sensor to sense all the touches polyphonically because one did not exist. So I had to spend some money on that and I also had to create a custom moulded playing surface out of silicone. But other than that I tried to reduce all my upfront costs. As much as possible, because I just don't have that much money in this industry doesn't pay a whole lot, especially for products that have new ideas. So I would say my biggest advantage is that I know a number of those things, but you have to, you have to know a few of them. Marketing, for example, I've always hated I always considered sales to be somewhat vulgar. And so I don't really do much in that regard. But I try to do instead of flashy advertising, it's just to make a good product. And in this day and age, there is a meritocracy of ideas and the internet. And if you make something that has merit, a number of musical instrument, websites will pick it up and talk about it. And they can be harsh. And so it has to be good. It has to work well. So I think what I do is I try to make the best product I can for the lowest product that I can afford and still make a reasonable profit. And then I have an advantage that I have a lifetime of experience in the different aspects of running a small company. And I have a name that sometimes people will say, Well, he's made good things before. And so I trust he will make good things again, I guess that's part of the answer anyway.

# What do you consider to be the biggest challenge when designing an instrument?

In my particular case, because my company is so small, and it's just just me, as I said, it's trying to figure out how to, to make what I'm going to make and and not go broke doing it. Because it costs a lot to do these things. It does take some help. And, and so it's it's a fair investment, even though I'm trying to limit my upfront costs. So it's not always it's always that trade off, trying to find a way to have a particular bit of design help or upfront fabrication costs for as little money as possible. And then trying to predict the market size, it is often difficult for something that's new idea. So it's tricky to you're always revising your estimates, I'm always trying to find new ways to do things at low cost. And, and, and provide the most effective sweet spot sweet spot between cost, hardwork, external resources, and estimating market size. And it's always stressful. And it's, it's difficult. But you know, after a while, I've just learned, if I can keep my costs low enough, and just keep enough cash in the bank and I can afford these things without getting into too much trouble, then what I tend to do is I tend to start slow and ramp up. And then there'll be a lot of demand at first. And I wish I could fill that demand. But it's just too difficult to make a prediction and hit the market with a whole lot of units already produced. So I just tend to ramp it up slowly at the beginning. And then eventually people who want it will be able to get it. 

# What tools do (or could) play the biggest part in helping with these challenges?

Well, I don't

I'm not sure if if I'm aware of any tool that I would like that doesn't exist. And so I'm just talking about science fiction stuff I would love to have on my 3d model a little button in the corner in that corner that says build it. But I don't think it's going to do me a whole lot good to suggest that to companies. But I would say among the tools that exist. You know that the ones I've mentioned are the most important ones, the 3d modeller. They are greeno system. Adobe Illustrator. spreadsheets are great for projections. I have my QuickBooks software, which doesn't do what I want it to do, but it's close enough and it doesn't cost that much. So I think for me, it's it's there are there are tools that I wish would exist. I wish the I wish like my laptop computer was faster. So when I'm doing 3d modelling renderings didn't take so long. I wish my accounting software QuickBooks was more suited for manufacturing and building materials. But it doesn't exist so I have to work around it. But other than that, I think I'm pretty up on what tools exist and what I can do with them. And that is If I receive some news or something comes along, then I'm very happy about it. But until that comes along, I have to do something.

> it seesm the main issue is inefficiency, anything that improves efficiency

Yeah.

You know, if I had big funding, it would be a different story, you know, is a great example. Um, well, first off to preface it, in my company, as I said, I'm just working in, in my office in my home. Actually, I'm in my living room now, because my wife works for Apple is is she's now commandeered the office, downstairs. But it's very low. Ongoing expense, it's very much scalable, which is extremely important for me, because that way I can weather any storm, if somebody comes out with a competitive product, and I'm wiped out, I don't have all these mouths to feed. So I tend to hire people as needed. And then I have a manufacturer that just makes a certain batch of the time, and all that sort of stuff. But I have no investment. And one of the problems with taking investment, is you have to pay the bastards back. So what I tend to do is one of the problems with taking investment is that right now, my mission statement is what I want to do, and still make a good amount of money doing it, or a fair amount of making money. If I take investment, my mission statement is to pay back the investors. And it's that's more difficult. So I don't take investment. I mean, people aren't beating my door down to give me money. But if I wanted to, I could get it. Now, by comparison, my biggest competitor is the Roli company in the UK, which is actually an American XPath **** who's a good friend of mine. And he has something in the order of $75 million in investment. And it is peak, he had I think 140 employees, and I think he's, he's scaled down a little bit right now. But he really thought that he had a very large market size, I think he thought it was less than he expected. But he did make a very high quality product. But in his case, since he didn't have all those skills, he was much younger, but a very smart guy, and a very ethical fellow, too. He had to draw on experts in those various categories. So his way of doing it was to get big investment, get the best people and, and make a very fine product. And I think he did that. It's just that. Ultimately, the big question is, does your product command the market size necessary for such an organisation. And, and the other thing too, is if you can't pay your investors back, you're kind of stuck, you know, so I've always preferred to be able to have the flexibility of independence from investors, I would feel too bad if I said, I can do this. And then I found that I couldn't do it. And I, I would find that I would have to work much harder to do that. So I prefer not to do that I prefer to have my mission statement be what I would like to do.

# How would you define a DMI?

Well I mean ultimately, these days, I mean, so something's got a computer inside. And it uses digital audio. But then again, there are digitally controlled analogue devices that, for example, the ones that my friend Dave Smith uses, makes, you know, they they have computers in them, but they're controlling analogue circuits, into other words to satisfy the needs of people who prefer this retro sound using analogue circuitry. And I would say that, if you include that group, then that will include all these products made since the 70s. That instantly had new features and new capabilities that were provided by software. And that was brought an explosion. And that was, I think one of the things that fueled my early success is I was able to create something that people said, Oh, this is much better than things that have come before. And it was important because I think I had some idea and some talent and design. But also it's because I was just at the right age at the right time to be among those who were adding microcomputers into products of all types, cars, microwave ovens, houses, and in my case, musical instruments. I was born in 1955. And Malcolm Gladwell, you know, the writer he, he had a book called outliers. And he has a whole chapter on people born in 1955, or there abouts, which included Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, I think it was Eric Schmidt of Google and a long list of other people who are very popular in the very successful in the computer industry. And you could argue we're sort of the modern day equivalent of the railroad barons of another age.

And his argument was that if you were born in 55, then when the microcomputer revolution hit in 1975, you're about 20 years old, you were old enough that you still weren't in high school. So you can do something. But you weren't quite old enough that you already had married and started and found this, you had to play it safe. So it was the ideal time to take a risk. And that's what was the case with, for example, Johnson gates, they dropped out of university and and started their companies. And in my case, it was the same thing I, I was at a time when it was ideal to

the age that it was ideal to take risk.

# What concepts do you consider a DMI to be made up from?

Know, I don't think it's really changed a free bit from acoustic instruments just with latest technology. The major thing is that it allows far more capability, and particularly capability other than developing specific musical skills.

But acoustic instruments have had a number of phases technology, then tubes for sound, they had strings for sound that frets to correct pitch. They had electrification amplification, pickups, and those were all technologies that made the most they could have that technology, towards improving the capabilities of the instrument, I would say that electronics, in digital musical instruments were sort of a step backward and step forward. At the same time, you had all these capabilities and software. But at the same time, people in the music industry tend to use the these cheap elements of switches, knobs and sliders. Despite the best efforts of companies early on like Yamaha, or other small companies that made try to make better human interface elements. The the predominant winning user interface was switches, knobs and sliders. And so most of the advantages went to the ability to prepare for the the automatic playing of music, as opposed to developing the real time playing skills. And for good reason. You know, why should you spend your whole life practising the violin to become a virtuoso when you can sit in your bedroom at night rolling a borescope around in front of a TV screen and programme in an excellent 32nd solo. So it made made a lot of sense for people to stop focusing on practising and progress, focus more on on programming. That course the problem with it is, is that you really don't get the same result of it, it's different, you end up making more background parts than than foreground parts. But I guess I would just in answer your question summary, I would just say that digital is just the latest innovation in technology and applied immediately. And before that, it was analogue electronics. Before that, like I say, it's tubes and strings and frets and and drum heads and, and passive drum heads that there's been a long line, long innovations, the invention of the clavier was very good. So you know that they're all things that altered music and and technology always alters music, I think we're always making the music that the tools want us to make. And that's no exception with digital tools. You know, a great example of that is looping. What are computers good at? They're good at taking easily replicatable tasks and doing them over and over again. That's what robots do. Well, what is the predominant object in most, ej DGM using its looping, so we're just doing exactly what robots are doing. And in automation, we're just looping apart. And a lot of dance music is just one loop to place instantly over and over again, with some variations, but always in the same key. If it's in any key at all. It's it's very it, it makes the music that the tools want to make. And so I'm hoping that for example instrument that it will expand the palette of the talent musician, so he isn't limited to making the music that the existing tools force him to make
